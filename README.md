# Simple Caret Example

This is a simple example on how to use the caret package
within the R environment.

## Sample Data
Some random data has been generated:

value1, value2, value3, result

The result depends on the 3 values (value1, value2 and value3). The goal
is to find a function, which maps the 3 values to the result.
